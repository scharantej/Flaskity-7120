## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: This file will serve as the main page of your single-page app. It will include the necessary HTML structure and React components to display the app's functionality.
- `base.html`: This file will serve as a base template for your other HTML files. It should include common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation, which you can extend and override in other HTML files.

### Routes

- `/`: This route will serve the `index.html` file, which will be the entry point of your single-page app.
- `/api/data`: This route can be used to fetch data from your server-side API. The data returned from this route can be used by your React app to dynamically update its state.
